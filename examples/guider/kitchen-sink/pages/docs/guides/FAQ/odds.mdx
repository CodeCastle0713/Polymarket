# How can Polymarket support social good?

*What looks like volatility is actually just real-time, granular analysis of public sentiment, much more up-to-date than traditional polls.*

People are reacting to what’s happening _right now_. So when something big goes down—a debate, a major news story—you’re going to see quick shifts in the market. But that’s not a flaw. In fact, it’s one of Polymarket’s strengths. This isn’t some static poll that’s already out of date by the time it’s published. It’s a living, breathing reflection of public sentiment in real-time.
